# Filter List Project

## Overview
The `filter_list` function is designed to process a list of integers, filtering out elements at positions that are multiples of 2 or 3. The function ensures the length of the input list is a multiple of 10, otherwise, it raises a `ValueError`.

## Features
- Validates that the input list length is a multiple of 10.
- Filters out elements at positions that are multiples of 2 or 3.
- Raises a `ValueError` if the input list length condition is not met.
- Includes robust testing with `pytest` to ensure functionality.

## Usage
To use the `filter_list` function, simply pass in a list of integers as an argument. Here's a quick example:

```python
from filter_list import filter_list

try:
    filtered_list = filter_list([1, 2, 3, ...])  # Replace with your list
    print(filtered_list)
except ValueError as e:
    print(e)
```

## Requirements
- Python 3.6 or higher
- pytest (for running tests)

## Running Tests
To run tests for this function, execute the following command:

```bash
pytest test_filter_list.py
```

The tests will check for various scenarios including the validation of list length, the filtering functionality, and error handling.
